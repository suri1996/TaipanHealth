        <h3>Consultative Service</h3>
        <p>
          Our mission is to give you access to additional information which you may or may not choose to utilize in planning your treatment. It is not a substitute for primary care and by use of this Site, no physician-patient relationship is created. The service provided through the Site may vary by condition and by location of residence of the patient, but our main service is providing a second opinion (sometimes referred to as a consulting opinion or an expert opinion) regarding diagnosis and treatment options based on the scan data you provide (include but not limited to X-ray, CT, MRI, ultrasound etc.).<br>
          You should understand that sometimes the online nature of the service will make it difficult to verify a diagnosis (especially with conditions that rely heavily on direct physician-patient interaction for accurate diagnosis).<br>
          The service provided through this Site is not the same as the typical diagnostic services provided by a physician. The medical professionals providing services through this Site cannot examine you in person or observe your physical condition. Therefore, the medical professional providing services through this Site may not have all facts or information that would affect his or her report of your diagnosis. To reduce the risk of this limitation to you, the Company strongly suggests you to discuss the second opinion with your physician. If you decide to use the services of this Site, you  agree that you are aware of this limitation and agree to accept the risk of this limitation. Also, you agree and accept that: (i) the diagnosis you will receive is limited and provisional; (ii) the second opinion is not intended to replace a full medical assessment or an in-person visit with a physician; (iii) the medical professionals providing services through this Site evaluate your diagnosis based on the digital scan data and any attached reports and or materials that you provide, but do not have important information that is usually obtained through a physical examination; and (iv) the lack of a physical examination may affect the medical professional’s judgement to diagnose your condition, disease or injury.<br>
          You also agree that the second opinion will not be used in any legal conflict including but not limited to lawsuit, arbitration, claim for disability benefits, claim for worker’s compensation and/or malpractice claims without the prior written approval of the Company.<br>
          By using any service through the Site, you authorize us to collect your medical scan data and records on your behalf from any and all facilities that may have such data, store those data, and transmit them to the physician or physicians for your case.<br>
        </p>

        <h3>Privacy</h3>
        <p>
          We are here to help you and provide you with information you need for peace of mind. If you have requested a second opinion service or another service, we may at any time review your case, your medical records before and after your interaction with the Site, and any reports and or records created as a result of services received. We may request additional medical records from your treating physician(s), including records related to care you received after receiving the services. By using the service, you are aware and agree that we use anonymous information gathered, including your medical records, to check the healthcare process and other matters. You are aware that we and our affiliated physicians and researchers may publish this anonymous information in books, journals, websites and other locations.
